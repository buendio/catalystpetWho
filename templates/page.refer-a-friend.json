You will receive a code in your email after a successful referral is confirmed. You can apply that code to your subscription from your portal (<a href=\"https:\/\/catalystpet.com\/account\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"null\">https:\/\/catalystpet.com\/account<\/a>). You can find \"add discount\" on the first screen you get to when you click \"Manage Subscription\".
