            "description": "<p>Clay litters, particularly those made from bentonite, can release silica dust when used and disposed of, which can be harmful to both cats and humans. Inhaling silica dust can cause respiratory issues, such as lung inflammation and silicosis. Additionally, ingesting clay litter, which happens when cats lick their paws after using a litter box, can lead to gastrointestinal problems. Natural litters like Catalyst do not release silica dust and can be safely ingested. As a result, they can be better for you and your cat's health!
